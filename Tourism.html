        and covers an area of approximately 26.8 square kilometres
        (10.33 sq mi). Surrounding the hills are seven peaks of 
        Seshachalam range, Eastern Ghats namely Seshadri, Neeladri,

        At the 21 km (13 mi) point on the Tirupati ,Tirumala Ghat 
        road, there is a major discontinuity of stratigraphic significance
        that represents a period of remarkable serenity in the geological
        history of the Earth. This is referred to as the Eparchaean Unconformity.
        This unconformity separates the Nagari Quartzite of the Proterozoic from 
        the granite of the Archean, representing a time gap of 800 Mya.[7] In 2001,
        the Geological Survey of India (GSI) declared the Eparchaean Unconformity 
        to be one of the 26 "Geological Monuments of India".

        The arch measures 8 m (26 ft) in width and 3 m (9.8 ft) metres in height and is 
        eroded out of quartizite of Cuddapah Supergroup of Middle to Upper Proterozoic 
        (1600 to 570 Mya) by weathering agents such as water and wind.

        Tirumala has a tropical wet and dry climate designated Aw under the KÃ¶ppen 
        climate classification. As the hill shrine is situated amidst the hills, 
        the temperature will go below 10 degrees in winter. Summers are not as hot
        here, especially compared to Tirupati. The southwest monsoon season starts
        from June, but rains are not heavy. Occasionally, thunderstorms form and 
        downpours may persist for hours. Pertaining to orographic relief, the
        northeast monsoon remains active over the region for 2 months.
        It causes flooding. The highest 24-hour rainfall on record was
